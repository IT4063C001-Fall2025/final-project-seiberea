    "Since the introduction of social media, patterens have been discovered that may correlate with reported mental health concerns in the youth population. Social media is now a staple in our daily lives and it's hard to come by someone who DOESN'T have any sort of social media account. Platforms like Tiktok, Twitter and Snapchat have all become way how we perceive the world around us and express ourselves. While on the surface it may seem harmless, studdies have shown that it just may do the exact opposite. This project aims to explore the depths of how social media may be the root cause of many mental health reports."
